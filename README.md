If tailwind is a car, Kyoshin is a steering wheel that forms a framework with your favorite Engine (CSS framework).

## Features
- **No build step**: Kyoshin builds your CSS using client-side JavaScript. This means you can use Kyoshin without setting up a complicated build pipeline, just include it as a `<script>` tag in your HTML and get started.
- **Tailwind Compatible**: Kyoshin tries to be compatible with TailwindCSS standarts, so you can use it without having to re-learn everything.
- **Use with a CSS framework**: Remember boostrap and bulma? You can simply add Kyoshin to your project and use it as a compliment with your favorite CSS framework.
