# Typography
Typography is the art of text arrangement. It involves the thoughtful and deliberate selection of typefaces, point size, line length, leading, tracking, kerning, color and any element that can affect a design.

## Colors
Kyoshin comes with a set of colors that you can use to style your text.

### Text color
Use the `text-<color>-<weight>` class to change the color of your text.

```html
<p class="text-red-200">This is a light red text</p>
<p class="text-blue-500">This is a blue text</p>
<p class="text-green-900">This is a dark green text</p>
```

### Background color
Use the `bg-<color>-<weight>` class to change the background color of your text.

```html
<p class="bg-red-200">This is a light red background</p>
<p class="bg-blue-500">This is a blue background</p>
<p class="bg-green-900">This is a dark green background</p>
```

## Font size
Use the `text-<size>` class to change the size of your text.

```html
<p class="text-2xl">This is a large text</p>
<p class="text-xl">This is a medium text</p>
<p class="text-lg">This is a normal text</p>
<p class="text-base">This is a small text</p>
<p class="text-sm">This is a smaller text</p>
